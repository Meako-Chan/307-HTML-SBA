HTML SBA Website


## A personal website or portfolio website written in HTML and CSS ##

This project is built off of an example of a YouTube tutorial on portfolio website creation
and based off of my own Google site.

How to run this project:

1. Clone this project
2. Right-Click on index.html
3. Left-Click on Open in Default Browser
4. The website should appear in a new tab on your default browser.

## Website Navigation ##
Following the instructions to run this project, you will end up on the front page inside
the index.html file.

There is only one way to navigate the website, and that is through the navbar at the top of the page.
The navbar includes the following:
1. Home
The front page (index.html). Simple introduction with a picture and nothing else.

2. About
Has another picture and a description of myself. There are three tabs below labelled Skills
